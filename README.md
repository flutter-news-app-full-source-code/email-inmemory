This `email_inmemory` package provides an in-memory implementation of the `EmailClient` interface within the [**Flutter News App Full Source Code Toolkit**](https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code). It is specifically designed for testing and development environments where actual email sending is not required. This package simulates the email dispatch process, allowing developers to verify email-related logic without the overhead or external dependencies of a live email service. It ensures consistent behavior and robust error handling based on the `email_client` contract.

## ‚≠ê Feature Showcase: Simplified Email Testing & Development

This package offers a comprehensive set of features for managing email sending operations in a simulated environment.

<summary><strong>üß± Core Functionality</strong></summary>

### üöÄ `EmailClient` Implementation
- **`EmailInMemory` Class:** A concrete in-memory implementation of the `EmailClient` interface, providing a standardized way to simulate email sending.
- **Simulated Email Dispatch:** Accurately simulates the `sendTransactionalEmail` operation without sending actual emails, making it ideal for isolated testing.

### üåê Debugging & Validation
- **Console Logging:** Logs simulated email details (sender, recipient, template ID, template data) to the console, which is highly useful for debugging and verifying email content during development.
- **Input Validation:** Includes basic input validation and throws standard `HttpException` subtypes (from `core`) on failure, ensuring consistent error handling in a simulated context.

### üíâ Interface-Driven Design
- **Decoupled Logic:** By implementing the `EmailClient` interface, this package ensures that application logic remains decoupled from specific email service providers, allowing for flexible testing strategies.

> **üí° Your Advantage:** This package provides a reliable, in-memory email client that simplifies testing and development of email-related features. It eliminates the need for external email service dependencies during development, offering immediate feedback and consistent behavior for your email logic.
